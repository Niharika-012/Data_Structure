Data Structures

A data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming that defines how data is organized, stored, and accessed in a computer's memory. It is like a blueprint or a framework that specifies the arrangement of data elements to enable efficient manipulation, retrieval, and modification of information. Data structures play a crucial role in solving complex computational problems and optimizing the performance of algorithms.
